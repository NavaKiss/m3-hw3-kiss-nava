<h1>Cody Johnson - The Return to "Real" Country Music</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Cody Johnson is a country music singer and songwriter hailing from Huntsville, Texas. He began playing music at the age of 12, singing and learning to play the drums, piano, and guitar at church. 

    Many listeners especially appreciate that Johnson, also know as "CoJo," grew up partaking in local rodeos, riding horses, and roping. Unlike many modern country-pop artists, they claim he knows what it means to be a "real cowboy," and actually connect with and relate to the topics he sings about.

<h2>Discography & Music</h2>
<p>Cody Johnson has released 9 albums to date, with his most recent, "Leather," kickstarting a worldwide tour of the same name. His 2016 album "Gotta Be Me" is his most successful release to date, debuting at No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart - without the support of a major music label. Though his music cannot be defined as one particular style of country, Johnson is said to have been inspired by artists like George Strait, Willie Nelson, and Merle Haggard, who hail from the "traditional" era of country music.

<h1>Cody Johnson - The Return to "Real" Country Music</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Cody Johnson is a country music singer and songwriter hailing from Huntsville, Texas. He began playing music at the age of 12, singing and learning to play the drums, piano, and guitar at church. 

    Many listeners especially appreciate that Johnson, also know as "CoJo," grew up partaking in local rodeos, riding horses, and roping. Unlike many modern country-pop artists, they claim he knows what it means to be a "real cowboy," and actually connect with and relate to the topics he sings about.
